# AngularAttack-2017

The intention of this hackathon project was to create an inline-wysiwyg editor.
Where upon finishing typing html tags will convert the text into the visual tag itself.

Highlighting and selecting an element will prompt the initial tag html code allowing you to directly edit the page you are working on.

Unfortunately this project did not go to plan within the time period.
While this may be feasible in AngularJS I believe AngularJS was not actually the best fit for this project.
Considering the amount of DOM manipulation if I were to tackle this again I would write this in JQuery.
